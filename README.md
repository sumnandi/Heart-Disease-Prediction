## AIM
This innovative project attempts to predict the presence of heart disease by utilizing base learners, ensemble combination rules and ensemble classifiers.
## INTRODUCTION
* Heart related diseases or Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the main reason for a huge number of death in the world over the last few decades and has 
emerged as the most life-threatening disease, not only in India but in the whole world.So, there is a need of reliable,accurate and feasible system to 
diagnose such diseases in time for proper treatment.
* In this project, the presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Multinomial Na√Øve Bias Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT).
* Along with this I have used one of the ensemble classifiers i.e. bagging., boosting and stacking
* I have taken various parameters into account such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score 
in order to analyze the performance and conducted a comparative study of the various models used.
