# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
## AIM
This innovative project attempts to predict the presence of heart disease by utilizing base learners, ensemble combination rules and ensemble classifiers.
## INTRODUCTION
* Heart related diseases or Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) are the main reason for a huge number of death in the world over the last few decades and has emerged as the most life threatening disease, not only in India but in the whole world.So, there is a need of reliable,accurate and feasible system to diagnose such diseases in time for proper treatment.
* In this project, the presence of heart disease is predicted by employing Multinomial Na√Øve Bias Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT).
* Along with this I have used one of the ensemble classifiers i.e. bagging., boosting and stacking
* I have taken various parameters into account such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score 
in order to analyze the performance and conducted a comparative study of the various models used.
## DATASET OVERVIEW
### 1. Graph Plot : Number of patients v/s Age
From this graph, it can be concluded that in the age group ranging from 41-60 years, the rate of heart disease is the highest.

### 2. Graph Plot : Gender v/s Target
The number of males and females in the dataset is 207 and 96, respectively. Out of 207 males 93 have a heart disease and out of 96 females 72 are suffering from a heart disease.

## CONCLUSION
The accuracy report of all the algorithms used are shown below.
It is observed that the accuracy has been increased by the using of Ensemble techniques namely Bagging and Gradient Boosting both having an accuracy of 81.3%.
